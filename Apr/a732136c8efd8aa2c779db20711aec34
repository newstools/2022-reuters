April 1 (Reuters) - A key part of the U.S. yield curve inverted on Friday morning in Asia, the second time in a few hours, according to Tradeweb data, as the two-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose above the benchmark 10-year yield . That part of the yield curve inverted on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019. It inverted again late in U.S. trade on Thursday. An inversion of the two-year, 10-year part of the curve is viewed by many as a signal a recession is likely to follow in one to two years. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
