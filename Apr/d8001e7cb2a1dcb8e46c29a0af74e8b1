Williams, citing events in 2019 when the economy slowed as the Fed approached a neutral rate, said "the experience from that is that we have to move to a more normal level but make sure we are assessing and evaluating...There is no question that is the direction we are moving. Exactly how quickly we do that depends on the circumstances." Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
