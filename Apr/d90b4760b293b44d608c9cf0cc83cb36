It provided no further details or explanation. German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday that the German economy ministry was considering expropriating the Gazprom and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) units in the country amid concerns about the security of energy supplies.  read more  The Kremlin said on Friday that any such move would be a violation of international law.
