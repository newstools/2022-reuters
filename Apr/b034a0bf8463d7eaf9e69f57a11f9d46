NEW YORK/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday, rising for three straight sessions, as civilian killings in north Ukraine and the prospect of increased sanctions pushed investors to seek safety in the greenback. The U.S. currency also continued to benefit from a strong non-farm payrolls report for March that backed expectations for a hefty half a percentage point tightening by the Federal Reserve at next month's meeting. "The dollar is bouncing higher as geopolitical developments have darkened clouds over the global economy," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. "The buck was already enjoying jobs-inspired gains after solid hiring and lower unemployment cemented expectations of super-sized U.S. rate hikes this year."

"More sanctions of course also mean that the risk of energy disruptions in Europe rises, because of our own sanctions or because Russia might get completely serious with its counter-sanctions rather than just changing the payment mode for natural gas," said Ulrich Leuchtmann, Commerzbank Head of FX. "In my view the risk of significant euro weakness increases." Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3% to 122.855 yen .
