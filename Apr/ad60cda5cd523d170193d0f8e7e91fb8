Discovery transition into a DTC (direct-to-consumer) powerhouse by focusing further investment in both content and the user experience, which has garnered complaints on both HBO Max and Discovery+," Morningstar analyst Neil Macker wrote in a note. Analysts at MoffettNathanson also signaled rising interest rates as a concern for the stock, adding there are concerns about slowing DTC subscriber growth across the industry.
