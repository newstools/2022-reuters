KYIV, April 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's state-owned railway company has temporarily restricted the transportation of some agricultural goods through border crossings to Poland and Romania, consultancy APK-Inform said on Saturday. It gave no reason for the restrictions. Ukraine, a major agricultural producer, used to export most of its goods through seaports but since Russia's invasion has been forced to export by train via its western border. APK-Inform said restrictions on the movement of goods to Poland through Yahodyn have been put in place from April 16 to April 18. There are also restrictions on the transportation of cereals, oilseeds, grains and other food products through Izov to the Polish towns of Hrubeszew and Slawkov. From April 16 until further notice, there are restrictions on the export of grain and seeds to Romania through the Dyakovo and Vadul-Siret crossings, the consultancy said. The railway company was not available for immediate comment. Ukrainian agriculture minister Mykola Solskyi said this week the main task of the ministry was to find alternative ways to export Ukrainian grain. The country has millions of tonnes of various commodities available for exports. Solskyi also said 1.25 million tonnes of grain and oilseeds were on commercial vessels blocked in Ukrainian seaports and may soon deteriorate. Before the war, Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain and oilseed a month. In March, exports fell to 200,000 tonnes. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
