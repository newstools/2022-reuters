April 6 (Reuters) - Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options under consideration in the Ministry of Defence include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, the report said. The vehicles would be stripped of sensitive equipment and British troops would be sent to a country neigbouring Ukraine to carry out training, The Times reported, citing a defence source. Further support, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, would be announced by Britain in the coming days, the report said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
