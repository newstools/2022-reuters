NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Buyout firm Thoma Bravo LP has contacted Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to express interest in putting together an acquisition offer that would rival Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk's $43 billion bid, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm that had more than $103 billion in assets under management as of the end of December, has informed Twitter that it is exploring the possibility of putting together a bid, the sources said. It is not clear how much Thoma Bravo would be prepared to offer and there is no certainty that such a rival bid will materialize, the sources cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. A Thoma Bravo spokesperson declined to comment while Twitter representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Thoma Bravo was considering a bid for Twitter. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
