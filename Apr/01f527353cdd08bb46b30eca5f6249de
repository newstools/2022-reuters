NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The classic private equity playbook still works. KKR (KKR.N) has agreed to acquire cybersecurity company Barracuda Networks from Thoma Bravo for $3.8 billion, Bloomberg reported. That’s more than double the $1.6 billion that Thoma Bravo paid for the company in 2018. Running the numbers implies the seller juiced profitability massively to produce healthy returns. KKR said on Tuesday that Barracuda now generates over $500 million in revenue. That implies sales have grown at about the same rate as when the company was public. If KKR has purchased Barracuda at a similar multiple to the one that Thoma Bravo paid in 2017, the massive increase in Barracuda’s value likely came through lifting its EBITDA margin from 20% in its last quarter as a public company to something closer to 36%. Putting this together with the amount of debt that Thoma Bravo used to fund the acquisition, the fund’s return might be more than 35%, Breakingviews calculates. Juicy returns like this are what all private equity firms aspire towards. (By Jonathan Guilford) (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are their own.)
