TAIPEI, April 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan chip company TSMC (2330.TW) posted a 45% surge in quarterly net profit on Thursday, Reuters calculations showed, boosted by a semiconductor boom from people splurging on devices during the pandemic that led to a supply shortage of chips. Net profit for January-March at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) , the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc supplier, rose to T$202.7 billion from T$139.7 billion a year earlier. That compared with the T$184.67 billion average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
