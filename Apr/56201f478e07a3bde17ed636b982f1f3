In cloud computing, customers can order as much computing power as needed in different parts of the world with a few mouse clicks. The software takes care of the mechanics of shuffling the data to the right physical machines. The lucrative data center chip business is rife with competition, with AMD rivals Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Nvidia Corp Only last month, Nvidia had released a new chip to speed up artificial intelligence functions in data centers.  read more  The deal, which would enable AMD to add Pensando's platform to its line of processors and graphics chips, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.
