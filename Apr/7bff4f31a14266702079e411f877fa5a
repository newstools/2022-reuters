NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Citigroup (C.N) isn’t so sure about special-purpose acquisition companies anymore. The bank run by Jane Fraser is putting its leading SPAC business on pause after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new regulations, according to Bloomberg.
