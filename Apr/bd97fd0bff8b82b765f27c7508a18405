April 1 (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 edged higher on Friday as the latest monthly jobs report signaled resilience in the U.S. economy, supporting an aggressive tightening policy by the Federal Reserve. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed that U.S. labor market was rapidly tightening while the rate of unemployment was dropping. U.S. employers added 431,000 jobs in March. While the numbers fell short of economists' expectations, the jobless rate dropped to 3.6%, the lowest since February 2020 and average hourly earnings increased 0.4%.  read more  "None of the information in today's report helps the Fed with the difficult task ahead and, if anything, the risk of faster tightening from the Fed in the near term remains highly conceivable," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. Traders now see a 72.8% chance of a 50-basis point interest rate hike in May. The U.S. central bank last month increased it by 25 basis points for the first time since 2018 and policymakers have signaled readiness for aggressive rate hikes to combat decades-high inflation. Another set showed U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in March as tight supply chains continued to drive input prices higher.  read more  Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors advanced in early trading, led by gains in energy (.SPNY) and material (.SPLRCM) stocks.
