April 18 (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 rose on Monday as Bank of America wrapped up earnings from big U.S. lenders with a better-than-expected quarterly profit, although elevated bond yields weighed on growth and technology stocks. Shares of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets (BAC.N) rose 3% as strong growth in its consumer lending business helped cushion the blow from a slowdown in deal-making. Overall, the S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) gained 1.5%.  read more  Market response to bank earnings has been mixed as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) combined put aside $3.36 billion in credit loss reserves due to risks from the Ukraine war and rising inflation.  read more  "Earnings will be good, but given the multiple years of high stock market returns, people do not look for good anymore. They look for great," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. "The fact remains that the pressures on the market are not going away. The combination of Fed policy, very high energy costs and the problems brought about by the Ukraine war are going to sit on the markets for the next few weeks unless there is some resolution." Megacap stocks including Tesla (TSLA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) edged lower as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hit a fresh December 2018 high of 2.88% earlier in the session. It was last at 2.83%.
