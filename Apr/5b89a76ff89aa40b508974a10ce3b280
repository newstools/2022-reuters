BERLIN, April 6 (Reuters) - A German consumer office has submitted a legal complaint against Google (GOOGL.O) over its use of cookie banners, which the office argues are designed in a way that violates data protection rules. That rejecting cookies, which collect data on users for targeted advertisements, requires more steps than consenting to them on Google's search engine websites is in violation of EU and national law, said North Rhine-Westphalia's consumer office. Google could not immediately be reached for comment. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
