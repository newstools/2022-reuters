July 18 (Reuters) - Instagram is getting a payment feature that will allow users to buy from small businesses through direct messages, parent company Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Monday. Users of the photo-sharing app need to message the business, add customizations if required and place the order in the chat, Meta said. (https://bit.ly/3odwc4q) They will also be able to track the order and ask the business any follow-up questions in that same chat thread. The feature furthers Meta's push to expand its e-commerce offerings. Earlier in 2020, the social media giant launched Shops as a way for people to find and buy products on Facebook and Instagram.
