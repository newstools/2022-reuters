BERLIN, July 10 (Reuters) - Siemens said Canada's decision to allow a turbine to be sent from its repair shop in Canada to Germany was a necessary first step towards returning it to the Russian pipeline it operates, and that it was aiming to get it there as soon as possible. "The political export decision is a necessary and important first step for the delivery of the turbine. Currently, our experts are working intensively on all further formal approvals and logistics," Siemens Energy said in a statement. "Among other things, this involves legally required export and import control procedures. Our goal is to transport the turbine to its place of operation as quickly as possible," it added.
