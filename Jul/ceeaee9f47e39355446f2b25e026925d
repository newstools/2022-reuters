MOSCOW, July 12 (Reuters) - A Moscow court fined U.S. tech giant Apple (AAPL.O) 2 million roubles ($33,900) on Tuesday for allegedly refusing to store the data of Russian citizens on Russian territory, the Interfax news agency reported. Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on battle since Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ($1 = 59.0000 roubles) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
