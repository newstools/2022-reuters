DUBAI, July 19 (Reuters) - Tehran is ready to export military equipment and weapons, Iran's army ground forces commander Kiumars Heydari said on Tuesday according to the student-led news agency Young Journalists Club (YJC). "Currently, we are ready to export military equipment and weapons," Heydari said, a week after the United States acccused Iran of preparing to send "several hundreds of drones" to Russia. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian rejected such accusations in a call with his Ukrainian counterpart on Friday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
