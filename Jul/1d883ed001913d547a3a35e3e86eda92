July 21 (Reuters) - Convenience store chain 7-Eleven slashed about 880 corporate jobs in the United States, a company spokesperson said on Thursday, as it finalises its organization structure. The retail chain, owned by Japanese retailer Seven & i Holdings Co (3382.T), cut jobs at its support centers and field support operations in Irving, Texas and Enon, Ohio, the spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. 7-Eleven joins a host of U.S.-based companies who have recently laid off their employees as the country struggles with broadening inflationary pressure. "We are just over a year into our integration process following the $21 billion Speedway acquisition and have made significant progress. As with any integration, our approach includes assessing our combined organization structure," the spokesperson added. In 2020, Seven & i Holdings had agreed to buy Marathon Petroleum Corp's Speedway gas stations for $21 billion. The deal boosted its 7-Eleven store count in the United States and Canada to about 14,000. U.S. activist investor ValueAct Capital bought a $1.53 billion stake in Seven & i Holdings last year, and has been urging the company to make structural reforms and sell off assets at 7-Eleven.  read more  In April, Seven & i Holdings said it would revamp its board as it seeks to accelerate overseas growth. The news of the job cuts was initially reported by CNBC on Thursday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
