July 18 (Reuters) - Defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) said on Monday it had won a contract to build and deploy a low-Earth orbit constellation of 14 satellites for the U.S. Space Development Agency. The satellites are part of the agency's plan to build the Tranche 1 Tracking Layer for detecting, identifying and track hypersonic weapons and other advanced missiles from their earliest stages of launch through interception. The agency said the Northrop award had a potential value of about $617 million. The space agency also awarded a similar contract to L3Harris Technologies Inc (LHX.N), with a potential value of about $700 million. The launch of the satellites is expected to start in April 2025.
