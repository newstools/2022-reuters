TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has hiked by nearly a fifth the cost of its flagship iPhone phone in Japan, which is battling a weakening yen currency and rising inflation. The Cupertino, California-based manufacturer's entry level iPhone 13 now costs 117,800 yen ($870), Apple's website showed, compared to 99,800 yen previously. With the dollar up 18% against the yen year-to-date, the higher cost of the iPhone, which dominates Japan's smartphone market, comes as consumers' wallets are being squeezed by price hikes for daily necessities. Such widespread hikes are a change for most Japanese following years of stable prices for many products. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
