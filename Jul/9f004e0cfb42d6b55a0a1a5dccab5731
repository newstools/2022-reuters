July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp said on Monday it has completed the preliminary design review for a high-energy laser that would have several defense applications if scaled. The company had last year won a $72 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to demonstrate a high-energy laser prototype. Developing higher-powered lasers that can track and focus energy on a moving target has been a long-time goal for the DoD with possible applications for missile defense systems. Northrop said it would test the prototype at progressively higher powers later this year. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
