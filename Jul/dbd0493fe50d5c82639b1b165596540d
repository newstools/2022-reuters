MELBOURNE, July 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Buy-now-pay-later app Zip (ZIP.AX) just achieved a rare distinction in the struggling industry: a higher valuation. Its battered shares jumped as much as 13% on Tuesday after scrapping an all-stock deal to buy smaller U.S. rival Sezzle , despite having to shell out $11 million to cover its target’s legal and other fees and the loss of some A$130 million ($87 million) in promised synergies. The mutually agreed termination highlights how quickly the once-sizzling fintech business has cooled in the face of rising interest rates, regulatory scrutiny and competition. Shares in $6.1 billion microlender Affirm (AFRM.O) have plummeted 78% this year. Sweden’s Klarna on Monday said it raised money at a $6.7 billion valuation, an 85% discount from last June. Australian payment provider Latitude (LFS.AX) last month rescinded its offer to buy Humm’s consumer division, which included its instalment-payment business. Zip reckons it’s still on pace to be profitable in a couple years with some A$300 million in cash and liquidity. The company told investors a few weeks ago that the Sezzle acquisition was on track, however. It’s hard to know where to derive much optimism. Perhaps not buying now will mean selling later.
