OTTAWA, July 8 (Reuters) - Quebecor Inc (QBRb.TO), through its unit Videotron, will intervene in the antitrust review of Rogers Communications Inc's (RCIb.TO) C$20 billion ($15.5 billion) purchase of Shaw Communications Inc (SJRb.TO), according to a notice posted on Friday on the website of Canada's competition tribunal. Last month, Rogers and Shaw agreed a deal with Quebecor to sell Shaw's Freedom Mobile unit to the Montreal-based company, in a bid to allay competition concerns about their merger. The Commissioner of Competition has blocked the deal, saying it would hamper competition in a country which has some of the highest telecom rates in the world. read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
