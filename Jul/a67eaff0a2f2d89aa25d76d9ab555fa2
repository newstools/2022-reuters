WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Cargill and Continental Grain Co said on Friday that they had closed their deal to buy Sanderson Farms Inc (SAFM.O), the third largest chicken producer, in a deal worth some $4.53 billion. Under the deal, which was announced last August, Sanderson is being combined with Continental Grain subsidiary Wayne Farms. Sanderson will cease trading on Friday. Any outstanding issues with the Justice Department were resolved prior to close, according to a person familiar with the matter.
