BERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - Germany's largest consumer protection group vzbv has filed a lawsuit against Tesla (TSLA.O) in a Berlin court over alleged misleading advertising and data protection violations, the group said on Tuesday. The group said Tesla made misleading statements on how much carbon-dioxide emissions consumers save when purchasing a Tesla electric vehicle. The car's sentry mode, which records its surroundings, also violates data protection laws, according to the vzbv. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
