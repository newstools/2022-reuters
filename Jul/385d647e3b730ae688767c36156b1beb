NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Large-scale bitcoin mining operations in Texas are back online after sweltering temperatures that caused electricity use to spike led to power curtailments earlier in the month, an industry group said on Tuesday.

"ERCOT is back into a normal operating mode with over 3,000 megawatts (MW) of spare capacity on the grid." The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the grid for more than 26 million customers and accounts for about 90% of the state's power load, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Power use in Texas is expected to break records again this week as the lingering heatwave keeps air conditioners cranked up.  read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
