FARNBOROUGH, England July 18 (Reuters) - The head of Qatar Airways confirmed on Monday that a provisional deal to buy at least 25 Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX planes had lapsed but added the airline could expand a separate order for larger 777x jets. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow that the memorandum of understanding for 25 737 MAX airplanes and options for 25 additional planes had expired, confirming a move that emerged in a court dispute with Airbus earlier this month. Qatar Airways could, however, increase its existing firm order for the 777x widebody jet. "We could give them a larger order." Al Baker said, declining to discuss specifics of negotiations.
