The capture of "El Huevo" in one of the most violent regions of the country generated armed attacks by his gang, the Northeast Cartel, against 22 military installations, 16 road blockades and collateral damage to the U.S. consulate in Nuevo Laredo, according to authorities. read more  Authorities sent more than 700 military personnel and four helicopters to secure the area on Tuesday, following the attacks. Trevino is connected to the family that allegedly founded the Los Zetas cartel, whose leader, Heriberto Lazcano "El Lazca," a former military man, was killed by Mexican soldiers in October 2012. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said one of his administration's main challenges is to combat the violence in the country, which has been incessant for years. He has faced criticism from his detractors for his security policy, based on the slogan "Hugs, not bullets." (This story corrects name of cartel to Northeast, not Northwest, in paragraph 4.)
