March 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Monday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments sparked bets of more aggressive interest rate hikes, adding to investor concerns as the Ukraine conflict rages on. The U.S. central bank must move "expeditiously" to bring too-high inflation to heel, Powell said in his remarks prepared for delivery to a National Association of Business Economics conference, adding it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed.  read more  Traders now see a 60.7% chance of a 50-basis point rate hike at the Fed's May meeting, up from about 52% before Powell's comments. The U.S. central bank last week raised interest rates by 25 bps to 0.25%-0.50%, the first increase since late 2018.
