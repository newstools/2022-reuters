Google and YouTube had earlier stopped selling online advertising in Russia following similar pauses by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.  read more  "As a follow-up, we're now extending this pause to all our monetization features, including YouTube Premium, Channel Memberships, Super Chat and Merchandise, for viewers in Russia," YouTube said in a statement on Thursday.
