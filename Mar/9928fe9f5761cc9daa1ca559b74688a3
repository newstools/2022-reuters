March 23 (Reuters) - Nikola Corp (NKLA.O) said on Wednesday it started production of its electric semi-trucks on March 21. Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell had said in a February earnings call that production will begin on March 21 and laid out plans to deliver 300 to 500 Tre BEV semi-trucks this year. Nikola is yet to report any revenue from truck sales. (The story corrects paragraph 1 to say semi-trucks, not pick-up trucks; removes reference to pre-series truck builds in paragraph 1; corrects paragraph 2 to say production will begin on March 21, not second quarter.)
