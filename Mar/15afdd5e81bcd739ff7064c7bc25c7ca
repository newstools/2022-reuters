March 10 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry on Thursday denied having bombed a maternity and children's hospital in Ukraine's Mariupol the previous day, accusing Ukraine of a "staged provocation" there. The ministry said that Russia carried out no air strikes on ground targets in that area on Wednesday, respecting an agreed "silent regime". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier that Ukrainian forces had taken over the hospital, while the Kremlin said their was a need to establish clear facts.
