(Reuters) - Squire Patton Boggs has expanded its M&A team in London with the addition of an energy-focused deal lawyer from Dentons. Christopher Thomson joins the 1,500-lawyer firm as a partner in its global corporate practice. A partner at Dentons since 2018, Thomson advises clients on corporate and asset-based transactions with an expertise in emerging markets including Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Eastern Europe, according to a statement by Squire Patton Boggs. Global co-head of the Cleveland-founded firm’s energy and natural resources group, Trevor Ingle, said Thomson’s track record complements the firm’s international upstream energy practice “at a time when we are experiencing ever increasing volumes of activity in that sector.” Upstream deal value rose 70% to $138 billion in 2021, led by the shedding of fossil fuel assets by large international energy companies, according to a recent report by accounting firm Deloitte. The report has a cautious outlook for 2022 considering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Omicron-induced supply chain disruptions. Thomson is Squire Patton Boggs’ fifth partner appointment in London in the past 18 months with Africa energy and projects experience, according to the firm. A Dentons spokesperson wished Thomson well on Friday.
