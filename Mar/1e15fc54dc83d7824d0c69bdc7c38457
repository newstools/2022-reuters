LVIV, Ukraine March 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine's new agriculture minister Mykola Solskyi on Saturday said Ukraine's ability to export grains was getting worse by the day and would only improve if the war with Russia ends. Speaking in a televised briefing, Solskyi said Ukraine, one of the world's top grain producers, would normally be exporting 4-5 million tonnes of grain per month - a volume that has fallen to just a few hundred-thousand tonnes. "The impact (on global markets) is direct, dramatic and large. And it continues. Every day the situation will become more and more difficult," he said.
