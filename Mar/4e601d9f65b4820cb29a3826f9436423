March 11 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes stumbled on Friday as tech and growth shares led a broad decline and investors worried about the conflict in Ukraine while attention turned to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.

"The market has had a tough couple of Mondays so I think the short-term players want to take some chips off the table."
