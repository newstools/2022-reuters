March 20 (Reuters) - Software maker Anaplan Inc (PLAN.N) said on Sunday it had agreed to be taken private by Thoma Bravo LP for $9.65 billion in cash, another sign of rising private equity interest in the cloud-based software space. The deal would give Anaplan investors $66 for each share held, a premium of more than 30% over the company's last closing price on Friday. Anaplan makes software that helps businesses model different forecasting outcomes and has more than 1,900 customers worldwide. Its revenue rose by about a third in the year to Jan. 31, while losses widened.  The highly leveraged buyout is the latest in the software sector, whose rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted interest from private equity players. Last month, software company Citrix Systems (CTXS.O) said it would be taken private for $16.5 billion including debt by affiliates of Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners. read more  The news of the Anaplan deal, which has an enterprise value of $10.7 billion, was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
