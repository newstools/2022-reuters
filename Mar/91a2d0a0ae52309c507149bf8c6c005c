BEIJING, March 17 (Reuters) - China opposes a U.S. crackdown on its telecom companies, the commerce ministry said on Thursday, after a U.S. regulator stripped Pacific Networks and its ComNet unit of authorisation to provide U.S. telecoms services. Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a news conference that China would take the measures necessary to safeguard the legitimate rights of its firms after the Federal Communications Commission voted on Wednesday to revoke the authorisation.
