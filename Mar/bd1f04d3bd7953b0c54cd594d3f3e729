BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai will meet Europe's antitrust chief on March 30 to discuss competition and digital issues, a European Commission official said on Thursday. Alphabet confirmed the meeting. Margrethe Vestager has handed out more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in fines to the world's most popular internet search engine in the last decade for hindering rivals in shopping comparison websites and online search advertising, and over its Android mobile operating system. She is also investigating Alphabet unit Google's digital advertising business and its online display advertising deal with Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O). Vestager has also proposed rules that could force Google and other U.S. tech giants to change their core business models. ($1 = 0.9093 euros) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
