(Reuters) - DLA Piper has brought aboard M&A partner Deepak Gill to its Vancouver, Canada, outpost, the firm said Tuesday. Gill joins DLA Piper from Cassels Brock & Blackwell, where he was a partner in its corporate and securities practice for a decade, London-headquartered DLA Piper said. Gill has advised public and private companies on general corporate and ‎securities law issues, focusing on mergers and acquisitions, capital market ‎regulatory compliance, initial public offerings and stock exchange ‎listings, DLA Piper said in a statement. Gill has also acted for senior levels of government and Crown corporations, which are government organizations with a mixture of commercial and public-policy objectives. He has often advised foreign enterprises on entry-to-Canada matters, DLA Piper said. Gill's clients range from those in the energy sector to media to hospitality. In 2015, Gill was part of a team that advised Antofagasta plc on its acquisition of a 50% interest in the Zaldivar Copper Mine ‎from Barrick Gold Corporation, according to his bio on DLA Piper's website. The deal was valued at $1 billion. He also advised NIBE Industrier AB on its $378 million acquisition of Waterfurnace Renewable Energy, Inc, the bio said. Cassels Brock & Blackwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Gill's departure.‎ DLA Piper was the principal advisor on 855 M&A deals globally last year, according to Refinitiv data.
