March 10 (Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell nearly 2% on Thursday as U.S. inflation rose to a four-decade high in February, cementing the chances of the Federal Reserve raising interest rate later this month. Monthly consumer prices rose 7.9% in February from a year earlier, the Labor Department data showed, matching economists' expectations.
