DUBAI, March 15 (Reuters) - The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance has been given a crypto-asset service provider licence by Bahrain's central bank, its first such licence in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the company and the bank said on Tuesday. "The licence from Bahrain is a milestone in our journey to being fully licensed and regulated around the world," said Binance Chief Executive Officer CEO Changpeng Zhao in a joint statement with Bahraini authorities. The regulatory requirements will "protect users with strong anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policies," he added. Financial regulators across the world have targeted Binance, with some banning the platform from certain activities and others warning consumers that it was unlicensed to operate in their jurisdictions.  read more  The licence permits crypto-asset trading, custodial services and portfolio management, the statement said.
