(Reuters) - Morrison & Foerster said Monday it has followed the lead of many other large law firms by opening an office in the "Silicon Hills" of Austin, Texas, citing the region's tech and life sciences industries. The San Francisco-based law firm's new six-attorney office will be managed by Bradley Wine, global co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s litigation department, who relocated to Austin from the firm's Washington, D.C., office. IP litigator Brian Nash and emerging companies-focused corporate attorney Steve Tyndall joined the firm as partners from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman in Austin, along with two associates. Aaron Fountain joined the new office as an IP litigation partner from DLA Piper. At least seven large law firms, including Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, O'Melveny & Myers, and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, opened in Austin in 2021. Morrison & Foerster appears to be the first of the largest U.S. firms to enter the Texas capital in 2022. Wine said Morrison & Foerster has had its eye on the Silicon Hills since 2019. "We see what's been happening in Austin, particularly around the tech and life sciences sectors, as aligning so well with our strategic areas of focus," he said. Fountain and Nash said they will be focused on working with emerging tech companies that have followed the flock of major corporations that have moved into Austin. According to Wine, the firm is actively looking to add corporate and IP attorneys in Austin, its 17th office globally. Neither a spokesperson from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman nor DLA Piper immediately responded to requests for comment about their attorneys' departures.
