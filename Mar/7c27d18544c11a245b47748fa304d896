March 11 (Reuters) - A Texas judge on Friday temporarily blocked the state from investigating parents of transgender children who provide them with gender-transitioning medical treatments that Governor Greg Abbott calls "child abuse." The ruling marked a victory for LGBTQ groups opposing proposals by conservative politicians in dozens of states to criminalize provision of gender-affirming procedures to trans youth ahead of midterm elections. The American Civil Liberties Union sued Abbott over his directive for probes that could remove trans children from families and jail parents who give them what he called procedures that "constitute child abuse." The February directive called on doctors, nurses and teachers to report such care or face criminal penalties. District Court Judge Amy Clark Meachum imposed a statewide temporary injunction on investigations by the Department of Family Protective Services (DFPS), saying it would remain in place until the case is fully litigated and settled by a judgement or other means. She scheduled a trial in the case to start July 11. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
