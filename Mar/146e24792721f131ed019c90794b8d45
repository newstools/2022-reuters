(Reuters) - Cooley continued a string of hires it's made this month, saying Thursday it has lured Washington, D.C.-based data privacy partner Michael Egan away from Baker McKenzie, where he has worked the last 14 years. Egan has joined Cooley as a partner in what the firm dubs its "cyber/data/privacy practice." He advises clients on how to prepare for and respond to data breaches and comply with data privacy regulations, the firm said. Egan has also represented companies before government agencies like the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, according to Cooley. Baker McKenzie said Egan advised consumer goods company Unilever Plc on the data privacy aspects of its purchase last year of food supplement company brand Onnit. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The firm has made several hires this month. Earlier this week, Cooley tapped the former head of Linklaters' global competition practice in Brussels. On March 14, the firm said it would open its second office in Los Angeles with a capital markets leader poached from O'Melveny & Myers. Egan said those moves affirmed his decision to join Cooley. Patrick Van Eecke, the head of Cooley's European cyber/data/privacy practice, said Egan's large firm experience at Baker McKenzie was a selling point in his hire. Clients want to call "someone who has been there, done that, and got the T-shirt," he said.
