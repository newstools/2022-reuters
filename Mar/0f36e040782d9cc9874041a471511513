SANTIAGO, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S.-based commodities trader Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) has agreed to acquire a 24.5% stake in the salmon farming subsidiary of Chile's Multiexport Foods for some $290 million, it said on Friday. Chile is the world's second largest salmon producer after Norway. Cargill is a leading supplier of salmon feed. Under the deal, Salmones Multiexport will also have a 1.13% stake sold to a local unit of Japan's Mitsui & Co (8031.T), whose stake in the firm will also reach 24.5%. Multiexport Foods is set to receive a total $303.3 million. The conditions of the deal - which still requires approval from antitrust watchdogs in the Unites States, Brazil and Chile - must be fulfilled in up to six months.
