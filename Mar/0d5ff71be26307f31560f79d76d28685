Tech giant HP Inc has turned to Davis Polk & Wardwell and Ropes & Gray to helm its acquisition, valued at $3.3 billion, of audio and video device maker Poly, which tapped Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati as legal counsel. The deal disclosed Monday will allow Palo Alto, California-based HP Inc to capitalize on the growing hybrid-work environment through the use of Santa Cruz-based Poly's products, including video conferencing solutions, cameras and headsets. Corporate partners Paul Scrivano and Cheryl Chan are leading the deal team for Davis Polk, while M&A partners Sarah Young and Matthew Jacobson are leading Ropes & Gray's team, according to statements from the law firms. Poly, formerly known as Plantronics Inc, worked with Wilson Sonsini corporate partners Katharine Martin, Martin Korman, Douglas Schnell and Remi Korenblit, the law firm said. Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom said in a statement it worked on antitrust aspects of the deal, led by partners Steven Sunshine, Frederic Depoortere and Andrew Foster. The deal between HP and Poly is expected to close by the end of the year. (Headline has been updated to clarify the number of firms representing HP Inc.
