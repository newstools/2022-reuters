March 18 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group has suspended all flights using Boeing (BA.N) aircraft due to Western sanctions, it said on Friday. Sanctions have cut off the supply of most aircraft and parts to Russia.

Volga-Dnepr, which describes itself as the world leader in the oversize and heavy cargo market, continues to fly Russian-made aircraft including An-124 and Il-76 cargo jets.
