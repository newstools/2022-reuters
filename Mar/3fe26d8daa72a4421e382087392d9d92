March 14 (Reuters) - A consortium of private-equity firms including Elliott Management is in talks to buy TV ratings company Nielsen Holdings (NLSN.N) for about $15 billion including debt, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Shares of Nielsen surged more than 35% on the news. Financing discussions with a number of banks are progressing and a takeover deal could be completed within weeks, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. (https://on.wsj.com/3KLv0hR) Nielsen is known for its ratings that are used to determine advertising rates for TV commercials, but the rise of streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ over cable TV has been limiting how Nielsen can measure ratings. The company had a market cap of $6.29 billion as of Friday close and its shares have lost nearly 15% so far this year. Activist investor Elliott had pushed Nielsen for a sale in 2018, forcing the market research company to consider splitting into two publicly traded companies a year later. But that plan was scrapped in 2020, when Nielsen decided to sell its consumer goods data unit for $2.7 billion to sharpen focus on its media business. (https://reut.rs/34H7DqD) Elliott owns 4.6% of Nielsen and is among the top ten shareholders, according to Refinitiv data. In 2006, Nielsen was taken private by a group of firms that included Carlyle Group and Blackstone Group. It went public again in 2011. Elliott did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Nielsen declined to comment. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
