(Reuters) - Boston-founded law firm Goodwin Procter on Thursday said it is expanding its M&A group by hiring Robert Masella, a co-leader of Shearman & Sterling's healthcare group. Prior to joining Shearman in 2015, New York-based Masella was a managing director in the M&A group at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a partner at Clifford Chance and an attorney at firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Masella has advised life sciences, healthcare and technology companies in deals and has represented Reuters' parent company, Thomson Reuters. "Deal after deal in the market, I saw Goodwin," Masella said. Goodwin closed out 2021 as the top legal advisor on global M&A transactions by deal volume, according to Refinitiv. The law firm last year worked on 1,112 announced deals worth $175 billion. New York-based Shearman in 2021 worked on 215 deals worth $124 billion, putting it in 36th place on Refinitiv's league tables. Refinitiv data on Thursday afternoon showed that Goodwin worked on 287 announced deals worth $51.7 billion in the first quarter of this year, more than any other law firm.
