WARSAW/LVIV, Ukraine, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a butcher who "cannot remain in power" after meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland, as Kremlin forces stepped up attacks across Ukraine, including the western city of Lviv. Biden's comments, an escalation of U.S. rhetoric towards Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, were not a call for regime change in Russia, a White House official said, but meant to prepare the world's democracies for an extended conflict.  read more  Just before he spoke outside Warsaw's Royal Castle on Saturday, four missiles hit the outskirts of Lviv, just 60 km (40 miles) from the Polish border, local officials said.  read more  Another strike significantly damaged Lviv's infrastructure but caused no reported deaths. As the fight since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour drags on, a visibly irritated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy again demanded Western nations send military hardware. He asked whether they were intimidated by Moscow, saying, "We've already been waiting 31 days."  read more  Biden, in a fiery speech ending a European trip aimed at bolstering Western resolve, framed the war as part of a historic struggle for democratic freedoms. "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," Biden said as he ended his speech. The Kremlin dismissed the comment, saying: "That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians." Biden, after meeting refugees in Poland, called Putin a "butcher". "We need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months," he said. "We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead." Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a "special military operation" include demilitarising and "denazifying" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies calls this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion. Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and the conflict has killed thousands of people, sent nearly 3.8 million abroad and driven more than half of Ukraine's children from their homes, according to the United Nations.

Ninety-year-old Olha Moliboha escaped from the northern city of Chernihiv just before Russia destroyed a bridge linking it to Kyiv, preventing further evacuations or humanitarian supplies.  read more  "They attacked and bombed us. They destroyed everything in our city. So many children have died, so many women," Moliboha, now in Poland, said tearfully from a wheelchair, her dog on her knees. "All our houses are destroyed, they are not there anymore. There is nowhere to live." Russian forces seized Slavutych, a town where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, and the mayor said three people were killed, Interfax Ukraine news agency said.  read more  Ukrainian staff have continued to work at Chernobyl after the site of the world's worst nuclear accident was seized by Russian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed alarm about the situation. Russian forces fired at a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv, Ukraine's parliament said.  In the encircled southern port of Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the situation remained critical, with street fighting in the centre. Mariupol has been devastated by weeks of Russian fire.

He warned of dire consequence if Ukraine - one of the world's major grain producers - could not export its foodstuffs and urged energy-producing countries to boost output so Russia cannot use its oil and gas wealth to "blackmail" other nations.  read more  The U.N. has confirmed 1,104 civilian deaths and 1,754 injuries in Ukraine and says the real toll is likely higher. Ukraine says 136 children have been killed. Russia's defence ministry said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday.
