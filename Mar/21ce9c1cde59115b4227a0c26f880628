LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Europe must protect its own security by helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told a meeting of Joint Expeditionary Force leaders in London via video link on Tuesday, urging them to send more weapons. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting a summit of Nordic and Baltic leaders to discuss European defence and security. "We all are the targets of Russia and everything will go against Europe if Ukraine won't stand so I would like to ask you to help yourself by helping us," Zelenskiy told the leaders. "You know the kind of weapon we need ... without your support it would be very difficult I'm very grateful but I want to say that we need more ... I do hope that you will be able to enhance that scope and you will see how this will protect your security, your safety." Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
