(Reuters) - Intel Corp convinced a U.S. appeals court on Thursday to cancel parts of a Qualcomm Inc telecommunications patent, reversing a patent tribunal's decision. The ruling by the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit comes three years after Intel challenged parts of the Qualcomm patent, which relates to receiving wireless communications over multiple carrier signals. The technology can help communications systems reach higher maximum rates for transmitting data. Intel argued that the invention could not be patented because it had been publicly disclosed in an earlier, unrelated patent application and a technical report by a telecommunications-standard group. A three-judge Federal Circuit panel agreed, reversing a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Qualcomm had previously sued Apple Inc for infringing the same patent and other chip-related patents. Qualcomm and Apple settled their patent dispute in 2019. Intel declined to comment on Thursday's decision. Qualcomm and its attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is Intel Corp v. Qualcomm Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 20-2092.
