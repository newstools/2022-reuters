BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Tough new rules targeting U.S. tech giants agreed late on Thursday evening are expected to come into force in October, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday, just over a year after she had proposed them. The rules called the Digital Markets Act sets out a list of dos and don'ts for Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O), with fines for violations as much as 20% of their annual global turnover.
