March 15 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that negotiations with Russia are to continue on Tuesday. Zelenskiy also said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett as part of a negotiation effort to end the war with Russia "with a fair peace." "Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. "Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow."
