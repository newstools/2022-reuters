FRANKFURT, March 9 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury division Porsche will suspend production of its electric Taycan model at the group's Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen plant until the end of next week, the company said in a statement, citing a lack of components. This means that about 200 Taycan cars cannot be built per day, Porsche said. However, production at Porsche's Leipzig plant, which has been suspended until the end of this week, will be partially resumed from Monday due to an improved supply situation, the group added. European carmakers are struggling to obtain crucial wire harnesses as suppliers in western Ukraine have been shuttered by Russia's invasion, forcing them to curtail production.  read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
