BERLIN, March 23 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in direct talks not to use biological or chemical weapons in Ukraine, Die Zeit weekly reported on Wednesday. Russian assertions that Ukraine was developing such weapons or that the United States wanted to use them seemed "like an implicit threat that Putin himself is considering using such weapons", the paper quoted Scholz as saying. "That's why it was important to me to tell him very clearly and directly: That would be unacceptable and unforgivable," Scholz told Die Zeit. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
