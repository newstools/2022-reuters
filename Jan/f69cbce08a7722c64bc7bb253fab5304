MILAN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Italian microelectronics company Technoprobe aims for a market value of up to 4 billion euros ($4.55 billion) in its initial public offering on the Milan stock exchange, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday. The group, which is the world's second-largest manufacturer of so-called probe cards used for the functioning of chips, said earlier on Tuesday it planned to launch the share offering by the end of the first quarter, aiming for a free float of around 20% post listing. The group reported revenues of 329.5 million euros in 2020 with a core profit of around 159 million euros. ($1 = 0.8798 euros) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
