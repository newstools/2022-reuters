Jan 7 (Reuters) - Venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz raised $9 billion through three new funds to invest across startups in different sectors, amid a global funding boom as large investors back high-growth tech startups at a record pace. The firm raised $1.5 billion for a biotech-focused fund, $5 billion for a growth fund meant for scaling startups and $2.5 billion for a venture fund, it said in a blog post on Friday. The latest fundraise, one of the largest from Silicon Valley venture funds in recent years, comes months after Andreessen Horowitz raised two new funds – a $2.2 billion crypto-focused fund in June last year and a $400 million fund for seed investments in early-stage tech startups. Andreessen Horowitz, informally referred to as a16z, plans to use the capital to double down on tech startups across different sectors. A number of its portfolio companies, including Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), Roblox Corp (RBLX.N), Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM.O) and enterprise software firm Samsara Inc , went public last year.
