LONDON, Jan 5  (Reuters) - The dollar held below two-week highs on Wednesday as traders awaited the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting, with growing expectations of a rate hike as early as March keeping the yen pinned near a five-year low. The minutes, due at 1900 GMT, could underscore U.S. policymakers' newfound sensitivity to inflation and their readiness to act. Markets have ramped up bets on a quarter percentage point rate increase by March and fully priced one in by May. "If tapering had ended a few months ago, we think the FOMC would be raising policy rates now with the unemployment rate not far above the Fed’s long-term target and core and headline inflation ...well above," Standard Chartered analysts said.

The Japanese yen  weakened past psychological support levels versus the greenback around 115.50 on Tuesday to hit a five-year trough at 116.35. It was trading at 115.90 on Wednesday. The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars struggled as fears of Omicron derailing the world's economic recovery subside. Sterling, meanwhile, has rallied about 2.7% on the dollar in a dozen trading days since Dec. 20 as traders also reckon surging Omicron cases in Britain won't deter the Bank of England from lifting rates.
