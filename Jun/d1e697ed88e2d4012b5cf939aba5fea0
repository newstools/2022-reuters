NEW YORK/WASHINGTON June 17 (Reuters) - TikTok has completed migrating its U.S. users' information to servers at Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), in a move that could address U.S. regulatory concerns over data integrity on the popular video app, the company confirmed to Reuters. The move comes nearly two years after a U.S. national security panel ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok because of fears that U.S. user data could be passed on to China's government.
