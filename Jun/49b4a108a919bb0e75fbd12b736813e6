PARIS, June 22 (Reuters) - The Paris public prosecutor's office said on Wednesday it had opened an investigation into allegations of rape against French Secretary of State for Development and the Francophonie, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, after two complaints had been received. A first complaint for rape was submitted on May 25, which led to the opening of the investigation on May 27. A second complaint was filed on June 16, the prosecutor's office said. Officials at the minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zacharopoulou, a trained physician, previously worked as a gynaecologist before moving to politics. French media earlier reported the complaints were linked to her professional activity. Another newly appointed minister, Damien Abad, Minister for Solidarity and the Disabled, already faces mounting pressure over rape accusations made by two women. Abad has denied the allegations and said he has no intention from resigning from the government.  read more  The investigation adds further pressure on President Emmanuel Macron's government after this weekend's election setback in parliament.
