VIENNA, June 8 (Reuters) - Iran has begun installing advanced IR-6 centrifuges in one cluster at an underground enrichment pant at Natanz in line with a plan announced long ago but it now also intends to add two more such clusters, or cascades, the watchdog said on Wednesday. "On 6 June 2022, the Agency verified ... that Iran had started to install IR-6 centrifuges in the aforementioned single cascade previously declared by Iran to the Agency," the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report to member states seen by Reuters and confirmed by the agency. It added that installation of the two extra had yet to begin. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
