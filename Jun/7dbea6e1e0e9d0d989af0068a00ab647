KYIV, June 24 (Reuters) - Ukraine needs "fire parity" with Russia in order to stabilize the difficult situation in the country's eastern region of Luhansk, Ukraine's top general told his U.S. counterpart during a phone call on Friday. "We discussed the operational situation and the delivery flow of international technical assistance," Ukraine's General Valeriy Zaluzhniy wrote on the Telegram app after a phone call with U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley. Ukraine has said Russia's artillery advantage on the Donbas frontlines is taking a significant toll on Ukrainian troops, and has called on its Western partners to supply more weapons to minimize the deficit. The United States will provide an additional $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including more long-range rocket systems, U.S. officials said on Thursday. read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
