HONG KONG, June 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares tumbled on Tuesday after Wall Street hit a confirmed bear market milestone and bond yields struck a two-decade high on fears aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes would push the world's largest economy into recession. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was down 0.9%. Australian shares S&P/ASX200 (.AXJO) sank 5% in early trade, while Japan's Nikkei stock index (.N225) was down 1.74%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index (.HSI) slipped 1.44% and China's CSI300 Index (.CSI300) was down nearly 1% at the open. The negative tone in Asia follows a bleak session in the U.S on Monday, which saw Goldman Sachs forecast a 75 basis point interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting on Wednesday.  read more  "The U.S. will see rate rises faster and higher than Wall Street has been expecting," James Rosenberg, Ord Minnett advisor in Sydney told Reuters. "There will likely be the double impact of earnings forecasts being trimmed and further price to earnings derating."

The benchmark S&P 500 is now down more than 20% from its most recent record closing high, confirming a bear market, according to a commonly used definition.
