June 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) raised prices for all its car models in the United States, its latest price hike amid ongoing global supply-chain issues. The electric carmaker increased its Model Y long-range price to $65,990 from $62,990, its website showed on Thursday, after delaying the deliveries of some long-range models in the United States by up to a month. The price hike comes as costs of raw materials have surged, including aluminium that is used in cars. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has warned about the risk of a recession in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Musk said he had a "super bad feeling" about the economy and said Tesla needed to cut 10% of jobs at the company.  read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
