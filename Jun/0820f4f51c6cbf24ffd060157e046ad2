It’s a cry for help for a broken market. U.S. tariffs, along with regulation, have given domestic manufacturers like Abbott a near-monopoly on baby formula supply.

As a result, pressures on the market only seem to help Abbott. After the FDA said on Wednesday it received a report of another child’s death, its shares closed slightly up, and the stock continued to rise on Thursday. The company said there is no current evidence that its products caused the death, and the White House has prodded overseas producers to prioritize U.S. orders.

Instead, tariffs need to be scrapped and quality control on the product needs to be tightened. (By Gina Chon) Follow @Breakingviews on Twitter (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.
