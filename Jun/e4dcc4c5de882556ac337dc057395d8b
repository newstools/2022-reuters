June 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday ruled in favor of Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) in overturning a more than $2.75 billion award of damages and royalties to Centripetal Networks Inc, a Virginia company that accused it of copying its cybersecurity patents. The U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., said the trial judge was disqualified from hearing the case once he became aware that his wife owned Cisco stock. It said the case should be reassigned to a different judge. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
