June 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes posted solid gains on Thursday, fueled by strong performance from defensive and tech shares that outweighed declines for economically sensitive groups as worries persisted about a potential recession. The benchmark S&P 500 swung between positive and negative during the session, but stocks picked up steam heading into the market's close. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell to two-week lows, supporting tech and other rate-sensitive growth stocks. Trading has remained volatile in the wake of the S&P 500 last week logging its biggest weekly percentage drop since March 2020. Investors are weighing how far stocks could fall after the index earlier this month fell over 20% from its January all-time high, confirming the common definition of a bear market. “There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the outlook and so the market is confused,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 194.23 points, or 0.64%, to 30,677.36, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 35.84 points, or 0.95%, to 3,795.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 179.11 points, or 1.62%, to 11,232.19. In his second day of testifying before Congress, U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell said the Fed's commitment to reining in 40-year-high inflation is "unconditional" but also comes with the risk of higher unemployment.  read more  U.S. business activity slowed considerably in June as high inflation and declining consumer confidence dampened demand across the board, a survey on Thursday showed. “The Fed wants to see things start to slow and the data is starting to reflect that,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A.
