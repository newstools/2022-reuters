June 27 (Reuters) - Chinese software giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) said on Monday it noted an announcement from two of its shareholders, South Africa's Naspers Ltd (NPNJn.J) and Prosus (PRX.AS), that they would start a long-term, open-ended share repurchase programme. The programme would be funded by on-market sales of Tencent's shares held by the two companies, Tencent said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
