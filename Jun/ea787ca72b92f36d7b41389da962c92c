SAO PAULO, June 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud announced on Tuesday it has invested 1.6 billion reais ($312.65 million) in technical infrastructure since 2017 in Brazil, as well as the opening of a new office and engineering center in the country. Google Cloud investments have been aimed at "helping the company's customers diversify their service portfolios, extend their digital capabilities, and drive new business," the company said at the Google for Brazil event in Sao Paulo, the country's financial capital. "During this (five-year) period, an amount of 1.6 billion reais was allocated to improve Google Cloud's technical infrastructure in Brazil." Google also announced the opening of a new engineering center in Sao Paulo and a new Google Cloud office in 2023.

"The investment (in a new engineering center) is another step in Google's plan to expand its engineering operations in Brazil. ... This will be the company's second engineering center in the country," said Google, which has offices in Belo Horizonte since 2006.
