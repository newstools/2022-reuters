BERLIN, June 21 (Reuters) - German grocery delivery app Gorillas is considering jobs cuts in Spain and has asked its workers to elect representatives for the process, the Berlin company said on Tuesday. Customers in the four Spanish cities where Gorillas operates - Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Alicante - will continue to be served for the time being, the company said in response to a Reuters request for comment. The start-up, which was founded in 2020, currently employs several hundred people in Spain, where its local competitors include Getir and Glovo. Last month, Gorillas said it would lay off 300 people, cutting its administrative staff in half, as it seeks to become profitable after growing rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
