BERLIN, June 23 (Reuters) - Audi plans to bring only electric-powered vehicles onto the market from 2026, Chief Executive Markus Duesmann told the Wirtschaftswoche weekly in an interview published on Thursday. Audi's entire offering will be exclusively electric-powered long before 2035, when the European Union plans to effectively ban the sale of combustion engine cars, Duesmann added.
