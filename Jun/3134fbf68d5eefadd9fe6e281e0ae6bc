BEIJING, June 9 (Reuters) - Removing all additional tariffs on Chinese goods would benefit China, the United States and the world, China's commerce ministry said on Thursday, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the Biden administration was looking to "reconfigure" tariffs. "We have noticed the recent U.S. remarks on considering cutting additional tariffs on Chinese imports. China's attitude on this issue has been consistent and clear," Shu Jueting, the ministry's spokeswoman, told a regular press conference. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
