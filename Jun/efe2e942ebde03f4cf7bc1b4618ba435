June 7 (Reuters) - San Francisco residents voted on Tuesday to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, Edison Research projected, in a nationally watched election viewed as a referendum on violent crime. Residents behind the recall effort blamed Boudin's progressive policies for a spike in gun violence and other crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, will choose Boudin's replacement in the liberal California city. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
