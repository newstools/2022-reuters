June 27 (Reuters) - Airlines canceled nearly 700 flights in the United States early Monday, as they struggled to keep up with a surge in summer travel demand due to a shortage of staff ranging from pilots to crew members. Total flight cancellations within, into, or out of the United States as of 6.07 am ET were 669, as per flight-tracking website Flightaware.com. Nearly 860 flights were canceled on Sunday. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) and Republic Airlines Inc had over 100 cancellations each, while American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) canceled 51 flights as of early Monday. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
