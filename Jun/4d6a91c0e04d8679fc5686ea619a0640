HONG KONG, June 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 after 156 years of British colonial rule. Here are some major transformations the financial hub has witnessed during the past 25 years.

More recently, COVID-19 and other factors have slowed down such arrivals, but also accelerated departures of longtime Hong Kong residents and expatriates frustrated with strict restrictions.
