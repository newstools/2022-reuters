WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. Federal Reserve’s preferred measure for inflation may leave it flat-footed when battling rising prices. The U.S. personal consumption expenditures index rose 6.3% in May from a year ago, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That presents a different picture from the other major measure of U.S. inflation. The consumer price index surged 8.6% last month, a bigger jump than the previous month. But the PCE index year-over-year reading in May was the same in April. That’s because they are calculated differently. CPI depends on household surveys while the PCE index relies on businesses, among other differences. Because the former puts more weight on everyday items like gas and food, it can be a better indicator of consumer sentiment  read more  and spending, the main driver of U.S. economic growth. Though the Fed  read more  also tracks consumer prices, the primary measure of success in hitting its 2% inflation target is based on the PCE index. A persistent divergence could prompt the Fed to underestimate rising consumer prices, prolonging the central bank’s inflation fight.(By Gina Chon) Follow @Breakingviews on Twitter Capital Calls - More concise insights on global finance: Li Auto makes hay while electric sun shines  read more  Lithium share sale charges Hong Kong IPO hopes  read more  Jupiter’s new CEO faces rockier ride  read more  Joe Biden readies to hook Chinese fishermen  read more  Russia default makes bondholders political stooge  read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
