WASHINGTON, June 3 (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Friday it asked Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) to respond to questions by June 20 after it received 758 reports of unexpected brake activation tied to the carmaker's driver assistance system Autopilot. In February, NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation into 416,000 2021-2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the United States after the agency received 354 complaints about the issue over the past nine months. NHTSA said the driver assistance system allows the vehicles to brake and steer automatically within their lanes. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
