LOS ANGELES, June 10 (Reuters) - Brazil has put forward "very ambitious" climate commitments and the United States hopes the Brazilian government meets them, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday. "It would make a huge difference to this effort that has to be a global one," Blinken told reporters, speaking at a summit in Los Angeles after the first formal meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday.
