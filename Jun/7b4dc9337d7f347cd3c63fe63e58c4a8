(Reuters) - Hogan Lovells said Wednesday it has hired former Foley Hoag mergers and acquisitions practice co-chair Alex Aber, as law firms continue to expand their corporate groups. Aber, who advises life sciences and technology companies, joins 2,600-lawyer global firm Hogan Lovells as a partner in Boston. He spent nearly 20 years at Boston-founded Foley Hoag, a much smaller firm with about 300 lawyers, according to his LinkedIn bio. Foley Hoag co-managing partner Jeffrey Collins in a statement said the firm wishes Aber well, and that "its practices are growing." "Foley Hoag remains focused on serving our venture capital and private equity-backed life sciences, technology, and clean energy clients," he said. Hogan Lovells said Aber is the fifth U.S M&A partner to join the firm in 2022. Among the four New York-based partners already hired was Adrienne Ellman, who also served as an M&A co-chair at Foley Hoag. Aber represents buyers and sellers in M&A and minority investments, the firm said, as well as founders and investors on other corporate matters. Hogan Lovells, among the highest-grossing law firms in the U.S., entered Boston about five years ago when it combined with a local litigation firm, Collora.
