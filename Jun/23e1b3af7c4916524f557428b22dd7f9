Wade ruling that recognized women's constitutional right to abortion.  read more  Women with unwanted pregnancies in the country now may face the choice of traveling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available, buying abortion pills online, or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion.  read more  The court's ruling led to a temporary spike in demand for over-the counter emergency contraceptive pills, known as Plan B, which are taken within days of sexual intercourse.
