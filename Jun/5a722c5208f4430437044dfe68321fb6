LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Britain's 'anti-corruption champion', lawmaker John Penrose, resigned from his role in government on Monday saying he would vote against Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a confidence vote later in the day. "I’m sorry to have to resign as the PM’s Anti-Corruption Tsar but, after his reply last week about the Ministerial Code, it’s pretty clear he has broken it," he said on Twitter. "That’s a resigning matter for me, and it should be for the PM too." Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
