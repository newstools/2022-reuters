LONDON/BEIJING, May 27 (Reuters) - World stocks were heading for their first weekly gain in eight weeks on Friday on a more upbeat earnings view while the dollar hit one-month lows after the Federal Reserve's minutes suggested it could put the brakes on rapid rate hikes later this year. Optimistic U.S. earnings outlooks overnight from department store operator Macy's Inc (M.N) and discount chains Dollar General Corp (DG.N) and Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) boosted stocks. The Fed's minutes of its May meeting released on Wednesday confirmed two more 50-basis-point hikes each in June and July, but policymakers also suggested the potential for a pause later in the year.  read more  "It's all flowed through from the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes," said Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM.

Markets would focus on the April core PCE price index for the United States due later on Friday for further signs on whether inflation was running hot, Coghlan added.
