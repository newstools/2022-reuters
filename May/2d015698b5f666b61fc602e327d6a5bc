SYDNEY, May 29 (Reuters) - Australia's new government has had a positive response from Pacific island leaders to its diplomatic engagement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, as he focuses on a region in which China is pushing its influence. China aims to build on a security pact it recently signed with the Solomon Islands, which has alarmed the United States and its allies who fear a greater Chinese military presence in a region they have held sway over for decades. "The response has been very positive," Albanese said in a television interview broadcast on Sunday, when asked about the reaction of Pacific leaders to his government's approach. Albanese has said plans for the Pacific include a defence training school, support for maritime security, a boost in aid and re-engaging on climate change.  read more  The Sydney Morning Herald reported on Sunday that more than 100 Australian defence personnel will travel to Papua New Guinea for a joint military exercise and to help it tackle cyber threats and organise a general election.
