STOCKHOLM, May 23 (Reuters) - T-Mobile (TMUS.O) on Monday launched a suite of 5G products to lure business clients and capture some of the market share of rivals Verizon (VZ.N) and AT&T (T.N), and has signed up customers including an automaker, an airline operator and a theme park. The product suite, what it calls 5G advanced network solutions, will offer three levels - from a complete private 5G network to sharing space over a public network, Callie Field, T-Mobile's president of business group, told Reuters. Field declined to name the customers. T-Mobile, armed with a bigger share of spectrum that is ideal for 5G than Verizon (VZ.N) and AT&T (T.N), is trying to make a dent in acquiring business customers despite the dominance of its more established rivals. One of its clients, SailGP, is using T-Mobile's private 5G in San Francisco where it saw latency drop by 50% compared with Wi-Fi while sending real-time analytics from boats traveling at 60 miles per hour. Having a private 5G network helps businesses avoid jostling for speed with others on a public network and enables data-intensive applications. Ports, airports, warehouses and logistics hubs are expected to be the first adopters of private 5G, and IDC estimates private wireless infrastructure revenue to reach $8.3 billion by 2026 from $1.7 billion in 2021. Field said T-Mobile was working with Dell for "edge computing" infrastructure for private 5G but could work with a vendor that a customer chooses as well. "Edge computing" helps in analyzing bulk data where it was gathered - factory floor or an oil rig - before moving it to remote servers, attracting big technology companies to offer their expertise. T-Mobile, in which Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) owns a 48.4% stake, has been gaining subscribers following its merger with Sprint and as it rolls out its 5G service.
