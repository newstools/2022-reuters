May 24 (Reuters) - One of President Vladimir Putin's top security officials said on Tuesday that Russia would achieve its objectives in Ukraine without being constrained by deadlines. "All the goals set by the President will be fulfilled. It cannot be otherwise, because truth, including historical truth, is on our side," Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with the Argumenty i Fakty newspaper. "We are not chasing deadlines," he added. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a "special military operation" to "denazify" and "demilitarise" its neighbour. But Russian forces have encountered multiple setbacks and suffered significant losses during the three-month campaign. "Nazism must be 100% eradicated, or it will raise its head again in a few years, in an even uglier form," Patrushev said, doubling down on Russia's stated aims for the military conflict. He also said Ukraine was being used by the West to contain Russia, echoing charges laid out by President Vladimir Putin to justify the conflict. "The ideal scenario for the whole of NATO, led by the United States, seems to be an endless simmering conflict," Patrushev said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
