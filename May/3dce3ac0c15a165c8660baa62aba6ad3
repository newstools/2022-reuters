May 27 (Reuters) - Russia will prepare a settlement mechanism before June payouts that will allow it to service its dollar-denominated foreign debt, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in a TV interview aired on Friday. Siluanov also said Moscow expects to receive up to an additional 1 trillion roubles ($15.27 billion) in oil and gas revenues this year, funds from which will be channelled to increased social welfare payments.
